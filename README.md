# DAVE--Digital-All-Vehicle-Electronics

DAVE is my attempt at creating an alternative to a regular RC remote. But in addition to that it should also be able to handle some sort of intelligent flight system.

If you want to know more about this project and how it was made check out my video:

This project ended up being kind of a failure. The main problem is wireless communication. For some reason the NRF24L01 modules I used where king of unusable and as soon as I am more than a few meters away the connection gets interrupted. At the moment I would strongly advise against using the files directly without modifications.
